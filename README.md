# Snake_Game_AI
One of my first solo AI projects. A simple ML model that learns to play the popular Snake game.

You can see how the model learns over time, it usually starts getting good at about 80 iterations. You can speed the process up by changing the in-game framerate.
Still some things left to optimize, like punishing the model for going in circles.
